The pool holds a token reserve split into a Real Token Reserve \(A\) (backed by actual assets) and a Virtual Token Reserve \(V\) (not backed by assets, used to set the initial price and liquidity). We assume the pool launches with \(A=0\) and no external supply; \(V\) therefore bootstraps pricing. The pool is said to be insolvent if its reserves are insufficient to accommodate the sale of all outstanding beans; otherwise it is solvent.
